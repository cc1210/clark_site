				<p>Nicholas Clark is a bassist, musical director, and producer from Fort Worth, Texas now living in Austin.  
				Prior to being a professional musician, he played college football at Texas State University where he won a 
				conference championship and received all-conference honors.  During this time, he focused on academics and also 
				became involved in the gospel music scene in Austin.  He graduated in 3 yrs and was a finalist in the prestigious 
				NCAA College Football Hall of Fame Draddy Award competition, which is the Heisman award for athletes who excel on 
				the field and in the classroom.  He won a scholarship through this award and with his last year of college 
				football decided to pursue a Masters in Physics.  While in grad school, Nick continued to excel in both the 
				national physics community and the local Austin music scene playing gigs with some of the top musicians in town. 
				After graduation, he was sought out by Samsung Austin Semiconductor and began the dual lifestyle of engineer by 
				day, musician by night.</p>

				<p>Although engineering is a competitive, fast paced environment, it was the best spot for Nick to be in a corporate 
				environment.  He began to gain influence in the Austin community through music and decided music would be his avenue 
				to encourage and inspire the world.  Within a year of being a full time musician, Nick became a highly sought out 
				musician for his versatility, work ethic, and professionalism.  He has been afforded the opportunity to play 
				bass for many of the top acts in the country across many different genres.  These include The Christian Mcbride Big Band(Jazz) 
				to Chrisette Michele(RnB) to Jon B(Pop) to Anita Wilson(Gospel) to Warren Hill(Smooth Jazz) and everything in between. 
				He continues to inspire, learn and rise to the top as an in-demand bassist and music director in the music industry. </p>
